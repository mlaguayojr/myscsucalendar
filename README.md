# myscsucalendar
Download your Southern Connecticut State University academic calendar.

# Reason
I got tired of having to manually create my school calendar in Google Calendar every semester. This program fixes that. Visit https://myscsucal.herokuapp.com/

# How to use
1. Log in with your bannerweb credentials.
2. If the credentials are correct, then you will see recent semesters to download.
3. Select the semester you wish to export to an iCalendar (ical file)
   * If the semester does not have any classes, then a calendar will not be exported. (duh)
   * If there are classes registered for that semester, then the program will auto download your calendar
4. Import your calendar into whichever program you use.

# Notice
This will not:
* store your credentials
* Include any classes that have a time as "TBA"

# Source Code
Yes. I will provide the source code relatively soon. I want to update the site some more. (This was a project I worked on in my free time.)

# What did I use?
* Python 3
* Bootstrap
* patience
